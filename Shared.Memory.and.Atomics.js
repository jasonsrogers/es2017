// SharedArrayBuffer
/*
To share memory using SharedArrayBuffer objects from one agent in the cluster to another (an agent is either the web pageâ€™s main program
or one of its web workers), postMessage and structured cloning is used.

The structured clone algorithm accepts SharedArrayBuffers and TypedArrays mapped onto SharedArrayBuffers. In both cases, the SharedArrayBuffer
 object is transmitted to the receiver resulting in a new, private SharedArrayBuffer object in the receiving agent (just as for ArrayBuffer).
 However, the shared data block referenced by the two SharedArrayBuffer objects is the same data block, and a side effect to the block in one 
 agent will eventually become visible in the other agent.

var sab = new SharedArrayBuffer(1024);
worker.postMessage(sab);

// In a nutshell, when you start getting involved in web workers to offload heavy pieces of work SharedArrayBuffer is you friend
// https://www.sitepen.com/blog/the-return-of-sharedarraybuffers-and-atomics/
// NOTE: To a lot of web dev that have not had to deal with native programming (C/C++) or things like webGL, this will feel weird
// In my opinion this level of optimization is good only if justified (high performance libs etc), but not for day to day stuff
// Because it's arrayBuffers, it is not clear/easy to understand what your passing back and forth at a glance as all your data is
// deconstructed to fit into an array
